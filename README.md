# Papaya clone for 2/3/20 interview

This repo is a very basic exercise into Android development, specifically to show:
* basic app navigation
* basic ui/ux design
* camerax lib exploration
* Volley http networking

The idea was to use the existing Papaya Android app as the parity target to identify critical features for development.

The project uses one main Application with child Fragments to represent the different drawer menu items.

## TODO
* Payment flow
* Integration with payment method APIs
* Integration with analytics
* Usecase unit and integration testing

## Business cases?
* Setup to sell to Snap or Facebook?
* Personal bill insights -> collective bargaining?
* Cash flow into 1 day pool, use for private equity?
